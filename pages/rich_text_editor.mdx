npx create-next-app my-tiptap-project

# change directory
cd my-tiptap-project
```

## 2. Install the dependencies

npm install @tiptap/react @tiptap/pm @tiptap/starter-kit
```

## 3. Create a new component

create new components called `Tiptap.js` for your editor

```javascript
"use client";

import { useEditor, EditorContent } from "@tiptap/react";
import StarterKit from "@tiptap/starter-kit";

const Tiptap = () => {
  const editor = useEditor({
    extensions: [StarterKit],
    content: "<p>Hello World! üåéÔ∏è</p>",
  });

  return <EditorContent editor={editor} />;
};

export default Tiptap;
```

let adding extension like bold , italic , img into our own text editor
open the extension sections chose what ever you want for example bold

## 5. Installation of extension

```

### Step 2 Call it in your extension

```javascript
const editor = useEditor({
  extensions: [Bold],
});
```
