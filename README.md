You save a snippet titled “Cover Letter” with this content:

I’m excited to apply for the position at your company...

When you click the snippet card:

1. A popup asks for company  
2. You fill in “Google”  
3. The final text is generated  
4. It’s copied to your clipboard  
5. You can also review/edit the generated result in the *workspace* area
